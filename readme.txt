ML1 Report
------------------------------------------------

The folder structure is the following:

/ML1_report
	/preprocessing_scripts
	/processed_data
	/raw_data
	/gam_R


-The file ML1_Report.html is the main report file.


-The file ML1_Report.ipnyb is the markdown file used to generate the HTML output.

-Preprocessing scripts folder contains 2 files, that cleans and merges 3 datasets in one and merges the last dataset in the other file.  

-Processed data folder contains the processed data file that we used in our analysis.

-Raw data contains 4 datasets before preprocessing with the metadata file for global economic indicators dataset.

-GAM R folder contains, train-test split data from python, R scripts for GAM analysis, related plots and summary tables.

--------------     Team Contributions   --------------

This project was a collaborative effort where each member contributed their expertise to different stages of the workflow:

- Data Selection & Cleaning:  
  Özarslan Irmak was responsible for selecting the macroeconomic and political datasets and performed comprehensive data cleaning to ensure the dataset was reliable for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  Batschelet Jimena conducted the exploratory data analysis, uncovering important trends, distributions, and relationships that informed subsequent modeling decisions.

- Modeling:  
    - Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Poisson Model: Özarslan Irmak implemented and tuned the GAM and Poisson models.
    - Neural Networks & Binomial Model: Chichko Kostiantyn developed the neural network models and performed the Binomial model analysis.
    - Linear Regression & SVM: Batschelet Jimena was responsible for implementing the linear regression and support vector machine models.

- Shared Responsibilities:  
  All team members collaborated on project planning, coordination, result interpretation, report writing, and presentation preparation. Peer review and feedback were integral at every stage, ensuring high-quality and reproducible results.
